## Image Generation Prompts

### HERO BACKGROUND (Landing Page)
**Primary:**
> "Ultra minimal abstract background, subtle flowing gradient from deep navy blue to soft purple-gray, very faint geometric mesh pattern with soft glowing connection nodes, professional technology aesthetic, clean and uncluttered, 16:9 aspect ratio, ultra high resolution"

**Backup:**
> "Dark gradient background transitioning from charcoal to deep blue, subtle constellation of small geometric dots connected by hair-thin lines, minimal and elegant, professional SaaS website hero style"

---

### FEATURE ILLUSTRATION: "One Prompt, Many Answers"
**Primary:**
> "Minimalist isometric illustration of a single white speech bubble at top splitting into three distinct colored response bubbles below (blue, purple, teal), clean vector style, subtle shadow, transparent background, professional icon design"

**Backup:**
> "Abstract illustration of one circle radiating outward into multiple parallel lines that each end in smaller circles, symbolizing one input multiple outputs, blue and purple gradient, minimal flat design"

---

### FEATURE ILLUSTRATION: "Discover Model Strengths"  
**Primary:**
> "Minimalist illustration of three abstract brain silhouettes side by side, each with different colored neural pathway patterns glowing inside (blue, purple, teal), comparison visualization, clean modern tech illustration style"

**Backup:**
> "Three geometric hexagon shapes in a row, each containing different abstract pattern (lines, dots, mesh), representing diversity and comparison, minimal flat design, blue-purple palette"

---

### FEATURE ILLUSTRATION: "Save Time & Money"
**Primary:**
> "Minimalist illustration of multiple scattered icons (chat bubbles, coins, clock) being consolidated into one unified streamlined interface shape, efficiency and simplification concept, clean vector style, blue accent color"

**Backup:**
> "Abstract funnel shape with multiple input arrows at top converging to single output arrow at bottom, representing consolidation and efficiency, minimal geometric design, purple-blue gradient"

---

### BYOK SECTION ILLUSTRATION
**Primary:**
> "Elegant minimalist illustration of an ornate key integrated with subtle code brackets and API symbols, unlocking concept, sophisticated tech aesthetic, dark theme compatible, blue-purple accent glow"

**Backup:**
> "Abstract keyhole shape with radiating connection lines emerging outward, representing access and unlimited potential, geometric clean design, soft blue glow on dark background"

---

### ONBOARDING TOUR: Welcome Character (optional)
**Primary:**
> "Friendly abstract geometric mascot made of stacked cubes and spheres, minimal robot-like appearance, welcoming open pose, soft blue and purple colors, clean modern 3D render style, white background"

**Backup:**
> "Simple geometric companion icon - circular face with two dot eyes and subtle smile, made of clean geometric shapes, friendly and approachable, flat design, blue-purple gradient fill"

---

### COMPARISON MODE ILLUSTRATION
**Primary:**
> "Split screen visualization with two abstract AI brain patterns side by side, connected by comparison lines and data points flowing between them, clean technical illustration, blue and purple dual tone"

**Backup:**
> "Two parallel vertical panels with different abstract patterns, bridge connectors between them, representing side-by-side analysis, minimal geometric design"

---

### LOADING/PROCESSING STATE
**Primary:**
> "Abstract thought bubble or brain shape with gentle pulsing concentric rings emanating outward, thinking/processing concept, soft blue glow, minimal and calming, seamless loop animation style"

---

## Style Guidelines for All Generations

### DO:
- Keep backgrounds clean with ample negative space
- Use soft gradients rather than flat colors
- Maintain professional, sophisticated tone
- Use geometric and abstract forms
- Keep color palette consistent (blues, purples, teals)
- Design for both dark and light mode compatibility

### DON'T:
- No cartoonish or childish illustrations
- No harsh neon colors
- No cluttered or busy compositions  
- No realistic human faces or hands
- No stock photo aesthetic
- No overly playful or casual tone
